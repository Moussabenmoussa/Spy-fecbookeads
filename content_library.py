        "title": "Cybersecurity Standards in Secure Resource Allocation",
        "body": "Zero-trust verification protocols are essential for preventing automated scraping of sensitive data. By validating every request through a secure gateway, systems can differentiate between legitimate human interaction and bot-driven traffic. This process maintains the health of the network and ensures availability for verified users."
